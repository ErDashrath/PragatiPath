🎉 ADAPTIVE HISTORY DETAILS IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully implemented the same detailed view functionality for adaptive history as assessment history, with enhanced AI-specific insights.

## Fixed Issues
✅ **Student Dashboard Error**: Fixed type error in `backendUserId` prop by converting `user.id` to number
✅ **API Fallback**: Enhanced `HistoryAPI.getDetailedAssessmentResult()` to handle both assessment and adaptive sessions
✅ **Visual Consistency**: All adaptive history tabs now have Eye icon and Details button
✅ **Data Transformation**: Backend adaptive data is properly transformed to match frontend expectations

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced History API (`history-api.ts`)
- Added fallback logic to try adaptive session API when regular assessment API fails
- Comprehensive data transformation from adaptive format to `DetailedAssessmentResult`
- Helper methods for calculating performance metrics, grades, and recommendations

### 2. Assessment History Component (`assessment-history.tsx`)
- Added "View Analysis" button to Mastery Progress tab sessions
- All adaptive session cards now have consistent Eye icon and Details functionality
- Proper prop handling for `backendUserId`

### 3. Detailed Result View (`detailed-result-view.tsx`)
- Added new "AI Insights" tab specifically for adaptive learning analysis
- Enhanced visualization with difficulty adaptation info, mastery tracking, and learning patterns
- Imports additional icons for better adaptive session representation

### 4. Student Dashboard (`student-dashboard.tsx`)
