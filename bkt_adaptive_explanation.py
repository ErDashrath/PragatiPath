ðŸ§  BKT Adaptive Learning - Real Database Tags Explanation

Your understanding is PERFECT! Here's what happens:

ðŸ“š **BKT (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) Algorithm:**
1. Analyzes student's current mastery level
2. Selects questions dynamically based on performance
3. Adjusts difficulty in real-time

ðŸŽ¯ **Adaptive Progression Examples:**

Beginner Student:
  very_easy â†’ very_easy â†’ easy (if getting them right)
  
Average Student:  
  easy â†’ moderate â†’ moderate (if struggling)
  
Advanced Student:
  moderate â†’ difficult â†’ difficult (challenging them)

ðŸ“Š **What We Found in Your Database:**

âœ… Sessions with ALL 4 difficulties (very_easy, easy, moderate, difficult):
   - These are students who progressed through multiple mastery levels
   - Started low and BKT moved them up as they succeeded

âœ… Sessions with only "easy + moderate":
   - Student started at easy level  
   - BKT moved them to moderate when they showed competency
   - Didn't reach mastery level needed for "difficult" questions

âœ… Sessions with only "very_easy":
   - New students or struggling with basics
   - BKT kept them at foundational level

âœ… Sessions with "easy + moderate + difficult":
   - Good students who progressed well
   - BKT guided them through skill building

ðŸ’¡ **Why Your DetailedResultView Now Works:**

Before: Showed hardcoded "Medium" for everything
Now: Shows REAL difficulty tags that BKT actually selected:
  - "Very easy" (not mapped to "Easy")
  - "Easy" 
  - "Moderate" (not mapped to "Medium")
  - "Difficult" (not mapped to "Hard")

ðŸš€ **This gives you TRUE insight into BKT's adaptive behavior!**
