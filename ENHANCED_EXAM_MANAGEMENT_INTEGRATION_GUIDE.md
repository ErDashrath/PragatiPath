   - Exam performance tracking and completion analytics
   - Student progress monitoring with detailed views

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **enhanced_exam_management_api.py** - Main API with enhanced schemas and endpoints
2. **Database Models** - Uses existing `Subject`, `Chapter`, `AdaptiveQuestion` models
3. **Analytics Engine** - Real-time statistics and question pool analysis
4. **Adaptive Engine Integration** - Links to existing BKT/DKT system

### Frontend Components

1. **enhanced-exam-management-interface.jsx** - Complete admin interface
2. **Dynamic Content Selection UI** - Interactive subject/chapter picker
3. **Question Pool Validator** - Real-time validation and statistics
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Comprehensive exam management overview

## üîß Integration Steps

### 1. Backend Integration

Add the enhanced exam router to your Django URLs:

```python
# In your main urls.py or exam app urls.py
from enhanced_exam_management_api import enhanced_exam_router

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns
    path("api/enhanced-exam/", enhanced_exam_router.urls),
]
```

### 2. Database Requirements

The system uses existing models from `assessment/improved_models.py` and `assessment/models.py`:

- ‚úÖ `Subject` model with proper SUBJECT_CHOICES and FK relationships
- ‚úÖ `Chapter` model with `subject` FK and indexing
- ‚úÖ `AdaptiveQuestion` model with `subject_fk` and `chapter` FK
- ‚úÖ `ExamSession` model for exam templates and instances
- ‚úÖ `QuestionAttempt` model for progress tracking

**No database migrations required** - uses existing infrastructure!

### 3. Frontend Integration

```jsx
// Import the enhanced exam management component
import EnhancedExamManagement from './enhanced-exam-management-interface';

// Add to your admin dashboard or routing
<Route path="/admin/enhanced-exams" component={EnhancedExamManagement} />
```

### 4. Authentication Integration

The system uses your existing authentication:

```python
# Uses session-based auth via /api/core/login
# Supports both admin and student views
# Integrates with existing user management
```
