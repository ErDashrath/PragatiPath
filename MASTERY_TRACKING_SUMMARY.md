### 2. Session History API with Mastery
- **Endpoint**: `GET /simple/session-history/{user_id}/`
- **Features**:
  - Returns all completed sessions with full mastery data
  - Shows mastery progression over time
  - Includes detailed performance breakdowns
  - Tracks mastery trends (improving/stable)

## ✅ Frontend Enhancements Added:

### 1. Updated Adaptive Learning Interface
- **Auto-completion**: Sessions now auto-complete when finished
- **Enhanced feedback**: Shows final mastery scores upon completion
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages if completion fails

### 2. Enhanced Assessment History Component
- **New "Mastery Progress" tab**: Dedicated section for mastery tracking

- **Detailed session history**: Each session shows:
  - BKT Mastery percentage and raw scores
  - DKT Prediction with confidence
  - Combined confidence levels
  - Mastery level badges (color-coded)
  - Achievement status (🏆 for mastery achieved)

### 3. Updated API Service
- **Simplified completion**: Uses new backend endpoint format
- **History integration**: Fetches mastery data from new endpoint
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for mastery data

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements:

### Session Completion Flow:
1. User completes adaptive test
2. System automatically calls completion endpoint
3. Mastery scores calculated and stored in database
4. User sees completion toast with final mastery level
5. Session immediately appears in history with full mastery data

### History View:
1. Navigate to Assessment History

3. See overview of mastery progression
4. View detailed sessions with:
   - Color-coded mastery level badges
   - Three types of mastery scores (BKT/DKT/Combined)
   - Performance metrics
   - Achievement indicators

## 🎊 Key Features:

✅ **Real-time mastery tracking** during sessions
✅ **Persistent storage** of mastery scores in database  
✅ **Automatic session completion** when tests finish
✅ **Visual mastery progression** in history
✅ **Color-coded mastery levels** for quick identification
✅ **Achievement badges** for mastery milestones

2. **Check history**: View "Mastery Progress" tab to see progression
3. **Track improvement**: Monitor mastery level changes over time
4. **Achieve milestones**: Work towards "Advanced" and "Expert" levels

## 🔧 Technical Notes:

- Sessions must be **COMPLETED** to appear in mastery history
- Frontend automatically completes sessions when finished
- Mastery data is stored in `session_config` field of StudentSession model
- User ID (not username) is required for mastery history API
- Both legacy and new mastery systems coexist for compatibility
