## ✨ What We've Built

I've successfully created a **complete Enhanced Exam Management System** with **Dynamic Subject and Chapter Selection** as requested. This is a comprehensive, production-ready solution that transforms your basic exam system into a sophisticated assessment platform.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Subject and Chapter Selection** 
- ✅ Support for all 4 subjects: `quantitative_aptitude`, `logical_reasoning`, `data_interpretation`, `verbal_ability`
- ✅ Database-driven chapter discovery using proper FK relationships
- ✅ Three selection modes: `full_subject`, `specific_chapters`, `adaptive_mixed`
- ✅ Real-time question pool validation and statistics

### 2. **Intelligent Question Sourcing**
- ✅ Direct integration with `AdaptiveQuestion` database model
- ✅ Dynamic filtering by subject, chapter, difficulty, question type
- ✅ Proper relational mapping using existing Subject→Chapter→Question hierarchy
- ✅ Real-time question availability analysis

### 3. **Advanced Exam Configuration**
- ✅ Dynamic duration and question count based on content selection
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty progression integrated with BKT/DKT algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive timing controls (warnings, auto-submit, expiry)
- ✅ Full configurability (navigation, review, proctoring, analytics)

### 4. **Smart Assignment and Scheduling**
- ✅ Auto-assignment to all active users OR manual student selection
- ✅ Scheduled start/end times with automatic status management  
- ✅ Real-time exam availability and expiry logic
- ✅ Multi-student management with individual tracking

### 5. **Comprehensive Analytics Integration**
- ✅ Subject-level analytics (success rates, response times, difficulty distribution)
- ✅ Chapter-level statistics (question count, average difficulty, estimated time)
- ✅ Real-time exam performance tracking
- ✅ Student progress monitoring with detailed views
