1,"Directions (1-10): Passage 1: The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, was a period of profound technological and social change. Innovations like the steam engine, the spinning jenny, and the power loom transformed textile production and manufacturing. This led to the rise of the factory system and mass urbanization, as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of work. While it brought unprecedented economic growth and new opportunities, it also created significant social problems, including poor working conditions, child labor, and overcrowded, unsanitary cities. The era reshaped Western societies, laying the groundwork for the modern industrial world and sparking debates about capitalism, labor, and social welfare that continue to this day. --- What is the main subject of the passage?","The social problems of 18th century Britain","The inventions of the Industrial Revolution","The causes and effects of the Industrial Revolution","The history of the textile industry","c","Easy","Reading Comprehension"

11,"Directions (11-20): Passage 2: Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, through a process that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugars (glucose) and oxygen. This process is crucial for life on Earth as it produces most of the oxygen in our atmosphere and supplies the chemical energy for most ecosystems. The entire process takes place within specialized cell organelles called chloroplasts. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is instrumental in capturing light energy.

21,"Directions (21-30): Passage 3: The concept of 'sovereignty' is central to the study of international relations and political science. It refers to the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a foundational principle of the modern state system. However, in an increasingly globalized world, the notion of absolute sovereignty is being challenged. International organizations like the United Nations, multinational corporations with vast economic power, and transnational issues like climate change and terrorism, all place constraints on a state's ability to act independently.

31,"Directions (31-40): Passage 4: The development of antibiotics in the 20th century was a watershed moment in medicine, transforming the treatment of bacterial infections and saving countless lives. Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928 was a serendipitous accident, but it paved the way for the age of antibiotics. These drugs work by either killing bacteria (bactericidal) or inhibiting their growth (bacteriostatic). However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to a critical global health crisis: antibiotic resistance. Bacteria can evolve to become resistant to drugs, rendering them ineffective. This means common infections could once again become deadly. Combating this threat requires responsible antibiotic stewardship, including prescribing them only when necessary, and the development of new antimicrobial treatments. --- What does the passage describe as a 'watershed moment' in medicine?","The discovery of vitamins","The development of antibiotics","The invention of the microscope","The understanding of viruses","b","Easy","Reading Comprehension"

41,"Directions (41-50): Passage 5: The gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs. Driven by digital platforms that connect workers with tasks, this model offers flexibility for workers and lower labor costs for companies. Workers can choose their own hours and projects, from driving for a ride-sharing service to freelance graphic design. However, this flexibility often comes at a price.
