## üß† AI Algorithms & Implementation

### 1. **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)**
**Location**: `assessment/bkt.py`

**Purpose**: Track student's knowledge state probability for each skill/topic

**Key Parameters**:
- `P(L‚ÇÄ)` - Prior Knowledge: Initial probability student knows the skill
- `P(T)` - Learning Rate: Probability of learning from one opportunity  
- `P(G)` - Guess Rate: Probability of correct answer when not knowing
- `P(S)` - Slip Rate: Probability of wrong answer when knowing

**Algorithm Flow**:
```python
def update_mastery(prior_mastery, is_correct, learning_rate, guess_rate, slip_rate):
    # Bayesian update based on student's response
    if is_correct:
        posterior = (prior_mastery * (1 - slip_rate)) / \
                   (prior_mastery * (1 - slip_rate) + (1 - prior_mastery) * guess_rate)
    else:
        posterior = (prior_mastery * slip_rate) / \
                   (prior_mastery * slip_rate + (1 - prior_mastery) * (1 - guess_rate))
    
    # Apply learning
    new_mastery = posterior + (1 - posterior) * learning_rate
    return new_mastery
```

### 2. **Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT)**
**Location**: `dkt-service/dkt_model.py`

**Purpose**: Use LSTM neural networks to predict student responses and knowledge state

**Architecture**:
- Input: Sequence of (question_id, response, timestamp)
- Hidden: LSTM layers capturing temporal learning patterns
- Output: Probability of correctness for next question

### 3. **Spaced Repetition (SM2 Algorithm)**
**Location**: `assessment/sm2.py`

**Purpose**: Optimize review timing based on forgetting curves

**Parameters**:
- Easiness Factor (EF): How easy the item is for the student
- Repetition Number: How many times reviewed
- Inter-repetition Interval: Days until next review
