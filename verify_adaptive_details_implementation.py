    print("✅ Changes Made:")
    print("   1. Enhanced HistoryAPI.getDetailedAssessmentResult() with fallback")
    print("   2. Added backendUserId prop to AssessmentHistory component")
    print("   3. All adaptive sessions now have Eye icon and Details button")
    print("   4. Same DetailedResultView component handles both types")
    print("   5. Added AI Insights tab for enhanced adaptive analysis")
    
    print("\n📋 How It Works:")
    print("   1. User clicks Eye icon on any adaptive session")
    print("   2. onViewDetails(sessionId) is called (same as assessments)")
    print("   3. handleViewAssessmentDetails sets selectedAssessmentId")
    print("   4. View switches to 'historyDetail'")

    print("   6. HistoryAPI tries regular assessment endpoint first")
    print("   7. If that fails, it falls back to adaptive session endpoint")
    print("   8. Data is transformed to match DetailedAssessmentResult format")
    print("   9. Same detailed analysis tabs are shown")
    print("   10. Additional 'AI Insights' tab for adaptive-specific features")
    
    print("\n🎯 Key Benefits:")
    print("   ✅ Same visual button (Eye icon) for all sessions")
    print("   ✅ Same API pattern and error handling")
    print("   ✅ Same detailed analysis depth")
    print("   ✅ Enhanced adaptive-specific insights")
    print("   ✅ No code duplication")
    print("   ✅ Consistent user experience")
    
    print("\n📱 Frontend Testing Steps:")
    print("   1. Start the frontend server")
    print("   2. Login to student dashboard")
    print("   3. Go to History section")
    print("   4. Check all tabs: Overview, Assessments, Adaptive Learning, Mastery Progress")
    print("   5. Click Eye icon (Details button) on any adaptive session")
    print("   6. Verify 5 tabs appear: Overview, Questions, Analysis, AI Insights, Tips")
    print("   7. Verify all data loads correctly")
